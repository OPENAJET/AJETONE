# AJETONE
Open Source 3D SLA/DLP Large format printer AJET ONE

# The project
In 2014 I was interested to develop own MIDI controller for music productions.

The Midi controller should contain interchangeable and freely puttable elements.
I was sure to build a prototype of the MIDI-Board I would need 3D printer.
The printer should be above all one, high-resolution.
It was an other requirement that his building area would have at least a size from 250x250mm.
And to good one last he should be still favorable.

Each of you might know that there was not such a printer.
In any case, no printer which would do justice to all demands.

Quick it was clear that I would have to develop this printer myself. Aim was to be able to offer a professional printer for less than 500$.

After long development time and numerous invested hours, different prototypes he was born, the AJET ONE.
Now there he stood Printing for me!

Now I added up how much a serial production would cost, immediately it became clear to me that the aim of maximum 500$ can be never achieved.

I decided to develop a professional version of the AJET, the AJET Per. Because this will cost, however, far more than 500$, I have resolved to publish the plans for the AJET ONE free of charge.
It was an aim that nearly everybody can afford the AJET and now this becomes true.
I hope that together with the community wonderful project originates.

#The AJET
 

The AJET was designed as a professional printer for serial production. The main reason was that everyone can afford this printer.After it became clear that a serial production would be too expensive I decided to make this printer available as OPEN SOURCE.

Details about the printer.
Ajet is available in various sizes and versions. In general, however, it is extensible.

Buildvolume:

Smallest version so far:  48mm x 27mm x 150mm(L/W/H)

Biggest version: 528mm x 297mm (or 400mm depending on projection ratio)  x 500mm (L/W/H)

XY Resolutions:

Depending on projector or lightengine: from 25mic up to 250 micron

Z Resolution:

Standard setup is able to do resolutions under 1 micron.

Normal prints should be done from 5 micron to 100 micron

# Step 1: Get the necessary parts.
The projection unit

First o all, you should be aware of the size and resolution you want. For this a few small calculations are necessary.

Calculate the Z resolution:

We just designed a calculator at the tools section.

Z Resolution Calculator
To get your Z resolution, you need to know how far your building platform increases per turn of the screw. In my tutorial we use a 3mm screw. Lets assume you use the recommendet setup using a 400 Stepps stepper equipped with a 1/27 gear ratio.
3MM / 400Stepps / 27 = 0,00027mm / Stepp.

So the AJET ONE-M will have a theoretical Z resolution up to 0,27 micron. Due to resin and material deviations, this resolution will not be achievable. Nevertheless we have chosen this setup. As you all know, a stepper motor may lose steps. Using this setup you will never notice that one step is missing.Another reason is the smooth movement.

Calculate the XY resolution:

We just designed a handy calculator for this:
XY Resolution Calculator

Buildsurface width / projector resolution. For example: 400mm/4000px = 100 micron
If you want to use a SLA Laser unit you need to do other calculations to get you XY resolution.
